# ESP-Nail v2 Premium Wood Box Enclosure

## Design Philosophy

The wood box is the premium enclosure option, designed to elevate the e-nail controller from a DIY project to a desktop-worthy appliance. It uses CNC-milled hardwood with clean lines, minimal hardware visibility, and a warm tactile feel.

## Construction Method

### CNC Milled (Primary)

The box consists of two CNC-milled halves:

1. **Base tray** - Bottom + four walls, milled from a solid block
   - Inner cavity pocketed to depth
   - Mounting standoff bosses left proud during pocket operation
   - Through-holes for IEC inlet, XLR connectors, USB-C port
   - Ventilation slots milled on sides

2. **Lid** - Flat panel with recesses
   - OLED display window (through-cut with 1mm lip for glass)
   - Encoder shaft hole
   - Model name engraved on surface
   - Lip/rabbet on underside for alignment with base

### Joinery

- Base: Milled from solid (no glue joints needed)
- Lid attachment: 4x M3 brass threaded inserts pressed into base
- Lid-to-base alignment: 2mm rabbet lip

## CNC Toolpath Notes

1. **Roughing**: 6mm flat end mill, 3mm stepdown, adaptive/trochoidal
2. **Finishing**: 3mm ball end mill for internal radii
3. **Through-holes**: Pre-drill pilot, then route with 3mm end mill
4. **Engraving**: 60-degree V-bit, 0.5mm depth

Stock: 20mm thick hardwood board (surfaced to 18mm).
